Inspection Rover Project - my_bot
This repository is built using a template provided by Josh Newans, which helped establish the foundational structure and guidelines for the project. The Sewer Inspection Rover is a modular, remotely controlled robot designed to navigate sewer systems and collect environmental data.

Project Overview
The Sewer Inspection Rover is developed to perform remote inspections of sewer systems. It is equipped with a variety of sensors, a camera, and motor systems, controlled via ROS2 on a Raspberry Pi 4 running Ubuntu. This project focuses on the integration of software and hardware to create a fully operational, autonomous inspection rover with real-time feedback capabilities.

Features
Remote Control: The rover can be operated remotely, providing flexibility for difficult-to-reach environments.
Camera Integration: The rover includes a wide-angle camera that streams real-time video.
Sensors: Environmental sensors monitor the conditions inside the sewer.
Custom PCB Design: The electronics are managed through a custom PCB, enhancing efficiency and space management.
Modular Design: The rover's structure and components are modular, allowing for easy modifications or expansions.
Technology Stack
Raspberry Pi 4: Running Ubuntu 22.04 for main control and processing.
ROS2: Provides a robust framework for managing control systems, communication, and data processing.
Custom PCB: Handles motor drivers, sensors, and power management.
3D Design: The chassis and parts are 3D printed, with future plans to switch to carbon fiber filament after testing PLA prototypes.
